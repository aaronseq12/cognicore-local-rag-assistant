# Project Phoenix: Technical Specification

## 1. Overview
Project Phoenix is a next-generation recommendation engine designed to provide personalized content suggestions. It will replace the legacy `LegacyRec` system.

## 2. Architecture
The system is built on a microservices architecture. Key components include:
- **Data Ingest API:** A FastAPI endpoint for receiving user interaction data.
- **Processing Engine:** An Apache Spark cluster for batch processing and model training.
- **Feature Store:** A Redis database for low-latency feature retrieval.

## 3. Data Security
All data in transit must be encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. Data at rest in our S3 buckets must be encrypted using AES-256. The security lead for this project is Alice.
